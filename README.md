### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I worked as an Android Developer. During my work, I implemented many features in Android Applications.
<!--
My current expertise is being able to implement features into applications not only using Java language, but I will be able to implement and build applications using Kotlin language, create dynamic and responsive layout design, SOLID code, and easy to maintain by other teams.
